Virome pipeline
Virome pipeline is a general pipeline constructed for viral metagenomes analysis from NGS read data. The pipeline integrates a series of open source tools, including STAR, MegaHit, BBmap, BLAST, ORFfinder and CAP3, which listed above are required when running the pipeline. In addition, Perl and R language environment are need to install and configure on the machine before running the pipeline.
